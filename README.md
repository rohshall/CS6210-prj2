### Sam Britt and Yohanes Suliantoro

To build:

 - Run `make` to build optimized executables in the `/bin` directory.
 - Run `make debug` to build non-optimized executables with debugging
   symbols in the `/bin` directory.
 - Run `make clean` to remove all compiled files and generated
   dependency files.
